Coding Quiz assignment

## The Assignment
Build a Javascript powered multiple-choice quiz

## What I Did
1. A welcome screen with a start button prompts a loop which pulls questions from an array. Correct answers are assigned 10 points and wrong answers take 10 seconds off the score.

2. When user answers all questions or the time runs out, they are shown their final score and asked to input their name.

3. A list of high scores is displayed and the user can click a button to either return to the welcome screen or clear the last high score entry.

## The Result

A quiz that alerts the user if they got the answer right or wrong and stores their scores for future viewing.
